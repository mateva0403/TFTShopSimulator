# TFTShopSimulator
This is a web-based program that uses JavaScript (Node.js) and HTML/CSS to simulate the shop mechanic from the video game Teamfight Tactics (TFT).

# Features
1. Simple user interface that dynamically displays a shop with five shop slots containing unit names and borders based on unit tier
2. Ability to purchase units that deducts from the unit pool and appends the purchased units to a list to track your inventory
3. Leveling system that changes the shop's unit tier odds
4. Uses real Teamfight Tactics/League of Legends unit names (assets belong to Riot Games)

# How to Use
Download the files into one folder and open the HTML webpage. 

# Notes
1. The repository does not include assets such as unit splash art.
2. The only way to reset level is to reload the webpage.
